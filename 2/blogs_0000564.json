Following the disappointing preliminary fourth quarter financial results announced Jan. 30, Fitbit stock sank 16% and has yet to recover. And based on the latest sale data from research firm IDC, a comeback isn't likely anytime soon. \nFitbit projected sales of 6.5 million devices in the fourth quarter, which is exactly what it was able to move during the all-important holiday shopping season. Yet despite a 16.9% jump in total wearable shipments to end 2016, Fitbit was one of two of the top five vendors to post a decline. The other major device manufacturer to share that dubious honor was Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ) with 2.1 million units shipped compared to 2.2 million a year ago. \nGarmin's smallish 4% drop in sales and 1.5 percentage point loss of market share to 6.2% was a hiccup compared to Fitbit's freefall. Fitbit shipped 8.4 million devices in Q4 2015. The 6.5 million fitness bands it sold to end 2016 was a 22.7% year-over-year nosedive. Fitbit's market share sank to 19.2% from 29%. \nNow, China's Xiaomi and Apple are both nipping at Fitbit's heels for the top spot. Xiaomi doubled sales to 5.2 million, leapfrogging into second place on the global sales list with 15.2% of the market. The iEverything maker rebounded from a poor third quarter with a yearly jump of 13% to 4.6 million devices, good for 13.6% of worldwide sales. \n10 stocks we like better than Fitbit When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
