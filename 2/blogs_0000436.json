Your metabolism determines the rate at which your body converts food into energy, meaning that the faster your metabolism is, the faster you will use energy and burn calories. Certain foods and drinks can help this process along, so by including some of these in your diet you will be on well on the way to having that amazing body you’ve always wanted. \n1. Hot Peppers \nCapsaicin is a chemical compound that is found in hot peppers or chilis , usually surrounding the seeds, and boosts thermogenesis – the process which turns calories into heat for fuel. So if you want a quick metabolism boost, make yourself a spicy chile con carne or blow your head off altogether with a vindaloo. \n2. Apple Cider Vinegar \nDrinking apple cider vinegar boosts your stomach’s ability to produce hydrochloric acid, which allows it to digest food easier and absorb nutrients better. As well as this, apple cider vinegar can act as an appetite suppressant, balancing blood sugar levels and helping to curb cravings. \n3. Water \nWe all know that water is good for us and essential to consume for our survival, but did you know that water can be great for weight loss and increase metabolism by up to 30%? Well it can! When cold water enters our body, our metabolism goes into overdrive as it warms up the water and makes it the right temperature to enter our stomach. Drinking water can also suppress your appetite as it prevents dehydration which can make you feel more hungry. \n4. Green Tea \nGreen tea is naturally high in antioxidants known as catechins which aid in weight loss by inhibiting the breakdown of fats and an inflammatory substance that triggers hunger. Drinking just three cups of green tea a day can contribute to a loss in body weight by 5% in just three months, if that’s not incentive enough to start drinking it we don’t know what is! \n5. Cinnamon \nSimilar to eating hot peppers, the presence of cinnamon in the body causes a reaction which speeds up the metabolism. Add some cinnamon to your oatmeal in the morning or include some in a breakfast smoothie and you can start the process of calorie burning and weight loss before the day has even properly started. \n6. Beans \nFoods that are high in protein such as eggs, beans and chicken require more calories to digest than any other micronutrient, so when you boost your protein intake you naturally increase the amount of calories you burn in a day. Beans are also rich in iron which helps to transport oxygen to muscles, allowing them to work more efficiently and, as a result, burn more energy. \nThere are so many more foods that boost your metabolism, so really the most important thing is to have a healthy and varied diet that contains enough proteins, carbs and fruits and vegetables to ensure you’re getting the right amount of nutrients into your body every single day.
