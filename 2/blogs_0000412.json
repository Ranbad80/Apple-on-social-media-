Mankind soldiers on, living out a hardscrabble life on the surface or holing up in great Vaults built inside caves. You're a member of Vault 13 somewhere in Southern California, and the Vault Overseer's got a job for you - find a replacement water purification chip within 150 days, or your home is doomed. Fallout 2 - It's been 80 long years since your ancestor, the Vault Dweller trod across the wastelands. As you now search for the Garden of Eden Creation Kit to save your primitive village, touch choices and even tougher consequences await you. Fallout Tactics Brotherhood of Steel - A departure from the character-heavy RPG style of traditional Fallout games, Interplay's Fallout Tactics - Brotherhood of Steel is instead a squad-based tactical RPG, utilizing both turn-based and real-time mechanics. As part of a split faction of the Brotherhood of Steel, the player controls a team that attempts to grow and expand across Fallout's barren wastelands by recruiting outsiders to embark on combat-heavy missions. Though vastly different from other Fallout titles, Fallout Tactics is a solid and enjoyable title that fans of the series would do well to explore. \n\nClick here to get this torrent:\nhttp://100torrents.com/Top100/Games/Mac/Fallout_1__2__Tactics_-_MAC_OS_-_GOG.html \nIF enjoyed it, maybe you will like it: Downloads of the Century \nThanks for the visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T12:45:51.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
