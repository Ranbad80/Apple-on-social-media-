I'm by no means, more no more than a novice computer user. I I would say I have a little more experience with Windows-based operating systems and also iOS operating system. Linux is very new to me and I've only used it a couple times before I ran it to my issues. I haven't been able to give it a fair assessment yet but I hope to work with it more and learn the system to see what it can do to make my life easier. Hopefully I can pass on any of my knowledge with these other operating systems or RATs if any info or insight I have can be useful to anybody. The past four months dealing with these RATs has been nothing short of trying, every free moment I have spent trying to take back my life that they've stolen from me. I hope this site will be able help me get rid of this problem and be able to move on to better thing. God knows I've spent enough hours on the phone with Microsoft and Apple and gotten absolutely nowhere with them. But on a brighter note, I really have learned from them both on how to point a finger. \n\n\\m/ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-04T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-04T11:50:55.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
