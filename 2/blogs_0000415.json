It would seem S3 services are down which has a massive ripple effect across the landscape of many companies that are relying on the storage system. \nAs you may know Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services. Amazon S3 provides storage through web services interfaces (REST, SOAP, and BitTorrent). \nAmazon released a statement: \n“We’ve identified the issue as high error rates with S3 in US-EAST-1,” which “is also impacting applications and services dependent on S3. We are actively working on remediating the issue.” \nChecking the status page: https://status.aws.amazon.com/ there is notice of Increased Error Rates in the system. \nAnd as a bit of irony, I attempted to use a one of my favorite sites Down Detector (http://www.isitdownrightnow.com) to see the status of other sites and “wow, its down also” \nThis now historic issue has affecting many services. Services such as: \nAdobe’s services, Amazon’s Twitch, Atlassian’s Bitbucket and HipChat, Buffer, Business Insider, Carto, Chef, Citrix, Codecademy, Coindesk, Convo, Coursera, Cracked, Docker, Expedia, Expensify, FanDuel, FiftyThree, Flipboard, Giphy, GitLab, Greenhouse, Heroku, Home Chef, iFixit, IFTTT, Imgur, Ionic, isitdownrightnow.com, Jamf, JSTOR, Lonely Planet, Mailchimp, Medium, MuckRock, New Relic, News Corp, Pantheon, Quora, Razer, Signal, Slack, Sprout Social, StatusPage (which Atlassian recently acquired), Travis CI, Trello, Twilio, Unbounce, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), VSCO, and Zendesk, \nNotably other services are affected but seem to be working. Snapchat services. Pluralsight‏, Airbnb, Down Detector, Freshdesk, Pinterest, SendGrid, and Time Inc. \nApple is acknowledging issues with its App Stores, Apple Music, FaceTime, iCloud services, iTunes, Photos, and other services on its status page: https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/ \n\nAnd.. Status updates from the AWS Teams: \n[RESOLVED] Increased Error Rates for Amazon S3 \nUpdate at 2:08 PM PST: As of 1:49 PM PST, we are fully recovered for operations for adding new objects in S3, which was our last operation showing a high error rate. The Amazon S3 service is operating normally. \nUpdate at 1:12 PM PST: S3 object retrieval, listing and deletion are fully recovered now. We are still working to recover normal operations for adding new objects to S3. \nUpdate at 12:52 PM PST: We are seeing recovery for S3 object retrievals, listing and deletions. We continue to work on recovery for adding new objects to S3 and expect to start seeing improved error rates within the hour. \nUpdate at 11:35 AM PST: We have now repaired the ability to update the service health dashboard. The service updates are below. We continue to experience high error rates with S3 in US-EAST-1, which is impacting various AWS services. We are working hard at repairing S3, believe we understand root cause, and are working on implementing what we believe will remediate the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T19:32:59.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
