The sales were officially suspended earlier this month, but it looks like the problem has since been fixed. \nIt has been noticed on Apple's Online Store that the LG UltraFine 5K display now has a shipping time of 1-2 weeks, which means that at the earliest, customers who place their orders now should be able to expect their delivery by the 8th of March at the very earliest, or the 15th of March at the latest, or at least that's what we hope barring any supply issues or unforeseen delays.\nThe good news is that it looks like the 5K models are still eligible for the discount so for now, they are still priced at $974 which is still expensive, but definitely cheaper than what Apple and LG had originally priced them at, so if you are thinking of getting a new display then perhaps you'll want to take advantage of this discount while it is still available.\nNote that this problem is only limited to the 5K models as the smaller LG UltraFine 4K models do not appear to have any issues. If you'd like to place your order, just head on over to Apple's website for the details.\nLG UltraFine 5K Displays Will Be Available In 1-2 Weeks , original content from Ubergizmo .
