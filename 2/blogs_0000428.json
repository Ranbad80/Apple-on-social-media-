Promising “live TV designed for the YouTube generation”, the offering includes the ability to stream the content of the major US networks ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN along with several cable operators.\nIt also allows the recording of shows in the cloud, with unlimited storage. Content can be viewed online, via Chromecast and on both Android and Apple’s iOS.\n\nThe US$35 per month package – which makes it more expensive than streaming service like Netflix or Stan but less expensive than most subscription TV packages – also includes access to YouTube’s premium Red Originals content\nThe service will initially launch in major markets in the US. A similar local offering would require extensive negotiations with local players such as free to air broadcasters Seven, Nine and Ten.\nA spokesman for YouTube owner Google told Mumbrella that there are not yet plans to launch the offering in Australia. He said: “YouTube TV is a US-only app at this time. This particular proposition is unique to the US TV market and any further roll out will be considered with local considerations in mind.”\nThe post Google announces YouTube TV, offering live television and unlimited recording space for $35 per month appeared first on Mumbrella .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T09:51:47.515+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
