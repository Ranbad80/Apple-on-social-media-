19:52, 28 February 2017 Welcome to Conservapedia! \nDonald Trump has instituted a sort of “open-door policy” for the Oval Office , permitting more than a dozen of his aides and assistants to have virtually unfettered access to speak with him. [1] \nBarack Obama had a much more restricted and regimented control in terms of access to the Oval Office. \nAn Arkansas state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would force the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock to be renamed after someone else.

It was nothing more than a rally for abortion , coming as it did one week before the March for Life .
