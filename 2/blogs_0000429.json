It was replaced by the \"third-generation\" Apple TV in 2012, which was nearly identical except for a faster processor.\nApple currently sells the 4th-generation Apple TV, which can now install apps from Apple's tvOS App Store. Apple is rumored to launch a 5th-generation model this year.\nApple \nIn June 2010, three months before the second-generation Apple TV launched, late Apple CEO Steve Jobs called the entire Apple TV product line a \"hobby\" in an interview — a remark that still shapes how people see Apple's television ambitions even today as the company has clearly placed additional emphasis on the device.\n\"The only way [TV is] ever going to change is if you can really go back to square one, tear up the set top box, redesign it from scratch with a consistent UI across all these different functions, and get it to consumers in a way that they're willing to pay for it. And right now there's no way to do that,\" Jobs said.\n\"The TV is going to lose until there's a better—until there's a viable—go to market strategy,\" he continued. \"Otherwise you're just making another Tivo. It's not a problem with technology, not a problem with vision, it's a fundamental go-to-market problem.\"\n\"I'm sure smarter people than us will figure this out, but that's why we say Apple TV a hobby. That's why we use that phrase,\" Jobs said.\nIt's striking to see how few of the landscape problems in Jobs' view have changed 7 years later. Apple has changed its strategy, though, and has recently emphasized the Apple TV as a platform for apps, although the company is still looking to sign up content creators for exclusive TV shows or movies, potentially for its own TV subscription service. \nApple typically declares a product obsolete 5 years after it stops manufacturing it. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T04:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T23:36:20.985+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
