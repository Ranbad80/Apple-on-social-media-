And won.\nToday gives us the ninth week in a row straight up, or 11 up if you don’t count that little red week in December.\nHere’s the Daily Chart and where we are with shares of Apple at the moment : \n\nAgain we see a stable, reasonable uptrend with visible swings and retracements.\nWe like to buy retracements (pullbacks) to rising trendlines or moving averages in strongly trending stocks.\nHowever, February gave us a volume surge on a price breakout through $130.\nFrom there, buyers haven’t given up any ground as both bulls AND bears (via stop-losses) aggressively buy shares.\nCongratulations to the bold Apple bulls – your efforts were magnificently rewarded in this powerful stock.\n\n\nFollow along with members of the Afraid to Trade Premium Membership for real-time updates and additional trade planning.\nCorey Rosenbloom, CMT\nAfraid to Trade.com \nFollow Corey on Twitter: http://twitter.com/afraidtotrade \nCorey’s book The Complete Trading Course (Wiley Finance) is now available along with the newly released Profiting from the Life Cycle of a Stock Trend presentation (also from Wiley).”\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-02T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T22:54:50.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
