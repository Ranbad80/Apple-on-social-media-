Infoblox tech firm expanding its workforce in Tacoma \nKate Martin | The News Tribune | 28 February 2017 \n“California tech company Infoblox is doubling the number of employees at its Tacoma office. \nInfoblox, which acquired cybersecurity firm IID a year ago for $45 million, will hire or move 50 more employees to the Tacoma location on Pacific Avenue. Worldwide, Infoblox has around 800 employees. \nThe company’s Tacoma office, in the Horizon Pacific Center at South 21st Street and Pacific Avenue, boasts a foosball table and a wine bar. To accommodate the new hires, the company is renovating two half-floors. \nSean Tierney, director of cyber intelligence, said Tacoma is close enough to Seattle to draw from its talent pool. Tacoma may be creating its own center of gravity in the cyber intelligence realm for workers interested in that field, he said.” \nView Infoblox job opening here . \nApple extending Seattle footprint with new offices dedicated to AI and machine learning \nRachel King | Venture Beat | 24 February 2017 \n“Apple real estate news continues to build up this week. \nAfter revealing the name of its soon-to-be-opened new headquarters in Silicon Valley, the iPhone maker is growing its footprint and workforce in Seattle—not far from the homes of Amazon and Microsoft. \nApple confirmed to tech news site GeekWire that the company will be renting out more floors at Two Union Square, a 56-story skyscraper in downtown Seattle, where it already leases two floors. \nThe new hires are expected to be working on projects primarily around artificial intelligence and machine learning—both of which could propel some of Apple’s existing software offerings (i.e. Siri) to better compete with the likes of Microsoft Cortana and Amazon’s very popular Alexa digital assistant.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T10:15:00.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
