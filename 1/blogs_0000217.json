Music Production & Light Gaming Hi all,\nLooking for some advice on a CPU/GPU pair. In a few months I'm going to build a Hackintosh/dual boot machine for the following purposes:\nMusic Production (Hackintosh – 70% of time): Ableton Live with mix of live audio input via an audio interface, and software VSTs. Typically up to 20/30 tracks at once. This is the priority.\nGaming (Windows – 20% of time): Cities Skylines, Civ, GTA V, Fallout, Skyrim, whatever Bethesda makes next. Cities and Civ are the priorities as far as gaming goes but I'd like smooth play with the others (which I know are more graphically intensive). I have a BenQ GW2765HT monitor (max 1440p 60hz) with no plans to upgrade that before, like, 2020. \nWeb Development & Light Photo/Video Editing (Hackintosh – 10% of time): Just casual web development and the occasional bit of photoshop or iMovie. No FCP or anything like that.\nMobo would likely be an Asus Z170I Pro Gaming Mini ITX. \nAbleton's CPU intensive, and so is Cities, so I'm inclined to really prioritize a CPU. For now, I'm limited to Skylake CPUs , so that likely means an i7-6700K. Ableton's supposed to do decently well with hyperthreading, which is why I'm leaning i7, and the K vs non-K price difference is negligible these days. \nThe main question then is the GPU: \nIf this was just a Windows build, I'd just get a 1070. But those don't (and probably never will) have OS X compatibility. \nI could get a 980ti on eBay but that's gambling on Apple and nVidia continuing to support that line (which is associated with the old Mac Pros). \nI could get an RX 480, which has decent current support and is more likely to have continued support for OS X, but it seems like the weakest GPU option.\nI could get whatever GPU and just run integrated graphics for the OS X side.\nI'm going to wait until after Apple's WWDC in June to see if they'll be rolling out any Kaby Lake or newer gen GPU hardware, so I'm mostly trying to figure out how much I should save up. Just looking for some insight.\nTL;DR: Would a 6700K with integrated graphics be enough for the hackintosh uses (music production, web dev, light photo/video editing)? Alternatively, is an RX 480 sufficient for my gaming needs? \nEDIT: Tentative parts list without GPU, would adjust PSU if necessary although hoping to keep the Node 202 (so massive GPUs are out).\nPCPartPicker part list / Price breakdown by merchant \nType Item Price CPU Intel Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz Quad-Core Processor $338.10 @ Newegg CPU Cooler CRYORIG C7 40.5 CFM CPU Cooler $29.99 @ Newegg Marketplace Motherboard Asus Z170I PRO GAMING Mini ITX LGA1151 Motherboard $159.91 @ Jet Memory *GeIL EVO POTENZA 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2133 Memory $94.60 @ Newegg Storage Samsung 850 EVO 500GB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive $167.99 @ Jet Storage Crucial MX300 525GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive $149.99 @ Jet Storage *Hitachi Travelstar 1TB 2.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive $56.45 @ Jet Case Fractal Design Node 202 HTPC Case $85.90 @ SuperBiiz Power Supply Silverstone 450W 80+ Bronze Certified SFX Power Supply $65.23 @ SuperBiiz Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts Total $1148.16 *Lowest price parts chosen from parametric criteria Generated by PCPartPicker 2017-02-28 21:23 EST-0500 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T06:04:29.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
