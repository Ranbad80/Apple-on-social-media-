Its settings enable users to install apps from anywhere or only from Microsoft Store. \nThe feature can also tell the system to “prefer” apps from the Store but to accept apps from anywhere, which means users will be warned about installing outside applications. \nI honestly didn’t know that there was a Windows Store that sold apps, but I guess it’s no surprise. If Microsoft does deploy this feature – which is currently just in a preview build – it could help make Windows PCs more secure. It also prods more people to buy apps through the Windows Store, which is what Microsoft wants. But for most users, this would be a good thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-01T14:17:25.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
