A study has revealed that there is a huge area for improving performance when it comes to iPhone. It can be simply put that the iPhone devices are not as reliable as Android counterparts.\nBattery problem is not the only issue with iPhone. A study shows that iPhone is less reliable in terms of performance when pitched against Android devices.\nThe data backed study proving the point \nWe are already aware of the battery problem in iPhone 6. Apart from that, in a recent report by device diagnostic firm Blancco it is revelaed that, mobile devices by Apple experience failure rate of 62% which is way more than Android devices’ 47%. This report is based on the data collected in the last quarter of 2016. It has been further stated that, the failure rate of iPhone has been increasing steadily, but iPhone 6 seems to be the worst of the lot. Despite its failure rate falling, it has added to the year-over-year difference of 47% in iPhone’s failure. In comparison to that, Samsung is the biggest offender amongst Android devices. Then again its failure is 27% in the 4 th quarter of 2016.\nThe meaning of failure \nIn this particular report, failure means a device’s inability of functioning notwithstanding the reason. This is one of the distinct possibilities for the failure rate being so high. This study also took into account problems like app crashes which happen to a lot of users every day.\nAre things being blown out of proportion? \nDespite the above mentioned numbers, we would suggest you to not take the report at face value. The source of the report is a vendor of mobile device diagnostic solutions. If the failure rate is high in a device, then it is good news for the vendor and its marketing strategy. Moreover, huge fluctuation between quarters has been shown through data in the report, which is unaccounted for to some extent. Another important point is that the data used in this study is most probably sourced from the services the company has provided. It renders the picture somewhat incomplete.\nThe worry remain though \nDespite these gaps in the report, there is no denying the fact that there are problems in iPhone and such performance is worry-inducing. For a company which is proud of its product quality and advertises accordingly, this report and those numbers (even if a little out of proportion) are worrisome. So, if you are experiencing problem with your iPhone and are wondering if the products sold in Australia are accountable, then that suspicion can be put to rest now. It is a problem users all over the world are facing.\nFor more such useful information, kindly follow us on Facebook , LinkedIn and Twitter . We will be happy to help.
